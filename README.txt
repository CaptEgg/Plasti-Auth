Plasti-Auth, Version 0.3
===================================================
This is an authentication plugin for Oracle Application Express 4.1. It's still under development and wont be ready for use in production until version 1.0. Feel free to contribute fixes and improvements.

Please read ADDITIONAL DETAILS and understand the risks before you enable session recycling.

Existing Features

* Requires a specified custom authentication function
* Recycle user session from browser cookie based on a page id whitelist
* Clear REQUEST variable when recycling to prevent default DML processes being invoked
* Optional confirmation page displayed before recycling takes place
* Error page displayed for incoming links to pages that are not in the whitelist
* Use the template of a given page when rendering confirm and error pages

Proposed Features

* Referer whitelist/regex and corresponding error page
* Configurable session recycling behaviour when landing on a public page with no session

INSTALLATION AND UPDATE
=======================
1. Ensure you are running Oracle APEX version 4.0 or higher
2. Unzip and extract all files
2. Access your target Workspace
3. Select the Application Builder
4. Select the Application where you wish to import the plug-in 
   (plug-ins belong to an application, not a workspace)
5. Access Shared Components > Plug-Ins
6. Click [Import >]
7. Browse and locate the installer file, plasti-auth.sql
8. Complete the wizard

If the plug-in already exists in that application, you will need to confirm that you 
want to replace it.  Also, once imported, this plug-in can be installed into additional
applications within the same workspace.  Simply navigate to the Export Repository 
(Export > Export Repository), click Install, and then select the target application.
Once the install file is no longer needed, it can be removed from the Export Repository.


HOW TO USE
==========
1. Install the plug-in (see INSTALLATION AND UPDATE)
2. Create a new page item
3. Pick "Plug-Ins" as type
4. Select the plug-in "Text Field Autocomplete - LOV Friendly"
5. Follow the wizard and use Item Level Help to get more information about the
   purpose and usage of the different settings.

Note that you can also update existing items to use this new item-type, once installed.


ADDITIONAL DETAILS
==================
It is not currently recommended to use this plugin in it's present state in any production environment where security is a concern.

External links into the system may be generated by an email notification or shared amongst colleagues. By default, such external links will trigger a new session to be created. The old session cookie is lost as soon as the login screen is displayed leaving the user with no way to recover their existing session.

Enabling session recycling avoids the need for the user to log in when clicking such links, but can also expose Cross-site Request Forgery vulnerabilities (CSRF). For this reason a whitelist of pages permitted for external linking must be filled in and any REQUEST variable passed in such links will be ignored to further reduce the risk of inadvertent DML from clicking a link.

IMPORTANT: To guard against CSRF, do not place DML page processes on whitelisted pages unless they are conditional on the REQUEST variable either explicitly or due to button submit conditions.

Even with these measures, JavaScript injected into any page in any application on the same domain could access the confirmation page in the background without the users knowledge and then dig out the session id without any user interaction. In future, this plugin will have configurable referrer checks to further mitigate such risks. Until this is implemented, do not enable session recycling on a domain that shares multiple applications.


FAQ
===
* Q: How can this improve my application?
  A: Allows users to painlessly follow links sent via notification emails or instant messaging amongst collaborative teams

* Q: Will this make my application less secure?
  A: Almost certainly yes, see ADDITIONAL DETAILS and then weigh up the risks

* Q: So is this essentially a trade off of security for usability?
  A: Pretty much, with the goal of making the security trade off as minimal as possible. There are some significant usability issues in APEX 4.1 that may affect some kinds of users more than others. See this wiki page for a full discussion and other possible solutions... https://github.com/CaptEgg/Plasti-Auth/wiki/Plasti-Auth-APEX-Authentication-Plugin


UNINSTALL
=========
To completely remove the plug-in:

1. Access the plug-in under Shared Components > Plug-Ins
2. Click [Delete]
   Note: If the [Delete] button doesn't show that indicates the plug-in is in use within the
         application.  Click on 'Utilization' under 'Tasks' to see where it is used.
